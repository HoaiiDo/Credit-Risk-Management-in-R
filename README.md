# Credit-Risk-Management-in-R

The expected loss EL a bank will incur is composed of three elements (multiplication of three)
1. Probability of default(PD)**:The probability that the borrower will fail to make a full repayment of the loan.
2. Exposure at default (EAD)**: The exposure at default, or EAD, which is the expected value of the loan at the time of default. You can also look at this as the amount of the loan that still needs to be repaid at the time of default.
3. **Loss given default (LGD)**: The amount of the loss if there is a default, expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

Building credi risk management model could also help international bank to determine risk Weighted Asset of Credit, Market, and Operational to maintain at least 8% threshold.
